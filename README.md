# Coronavirus twitter analysis

## Background 

In the year of 2020, coronavirus created a huge influence to everyone globally. Approximately 500 million tweets are sent everyday.
Of those tweets, about 1% are *geotagged*. In this project, I scanned all geotagged tweets sent in 2020 to monitor for the spread of the coronavirus on social media by language and by location. This project aims to demonstrate the number of tweets contained COVID-related tags by languages used and by countries located.


## Methodology

For my analysis, I followed the [MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) procedure, a famous procedure for large scale parallel processing that is widely used in industry, summarized in the following image:

The analysis is divided into three parts:
1. Mapping: summarizes formatted information in the folder `outputs`
2. Reducing: merges the outputs generated by the `map.py` file so that the combined files can be visualized
3. Visualizing: a nicer visualization of the result from the reduced files 

The COVID-related hashtags that have been tracked are the following:
```
hashtags = [
    '#코로나바이러스',  # korean
    '#コロナウイルス',  # japanese
    '#冠状病毒',        # chinese
    '#covid2019',
    '#covid-2019',
    '#covid19',
    '#covid-19',
    '#coronavirus',
    '#corona',
    '#virus',
    '#flu',
    '#sick',
    '#cough',
    '#sneeze',
    '#hospital',
    '#nurse',
    '#doctor',
    ]
```
